            Shootouts explode in balletic gunfights, each bullet ringing with consequence. Morality bleeds into every choice, from helping a stranger in need to pulling off a daring heist.
            The story, a Shakespearean tragedy of loyalty and redemption, unfolds through Arthur's eyes, his gruff exterior slowly revealing a depth of humanity that will leave you heartbroken.
