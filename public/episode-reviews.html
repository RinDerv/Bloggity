                              In 2006, unshakeable confidence binds young Gojou and Geto as they navigate moral quagmires, while 12 years later,
                               seasoned sorcerers like Gojou face an existential threat from united curses who plot his downfall in a chaotic Shibuya massacre.
                               Students, sorcerers, and curses clash over the very future of humanity in this battle for dominance fueled by negative emotions and cursed energy.</p>

                              (thought mahito would try to turn him into a zombie) or try to attack mahito before he died. Why not turn him 
                              into a transfigured human? Oh well, happy hes gone. Itadori getting a power of friendship/memories power up before
                              fighting half of mahito makes the power scaling a little confusing between demon and sorcers. Nobara fighting the
                              other half of mahito espically makes the power scaling confusing. Getting golded by the blonde hair dude and now fighting 
                              half mahito seems like a crazy jump to be honest. Should be an easy wash for mahito, but we'll see. The animation was really good, the hand 
                              to hand stuff was great. </p>

                              Her fight wasnt that interesting, boring flashback, inshallah shes dead. I dont think she is because she didnt explode
                              or turn into a disfigured human off the bat like nanami but well see. Maybe something about half of mahito wasnt strong enough
                              to transfigure her. We shall see.</p>

                              still awesome. King Todou was the highlight by far, fire speech, the animators love him clearly.
                              Itadori doesnt have that dog in him, not surprised though. The healing dude hella convenient, I know he
                              saved nobara. I dont remember him in the training arc previously.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Action packed episode that looked good pretty much the whole time. Mahito using the same domain expansion technique Gojo did 
                              against them was clever. Whatever explanation they were doing mid way through that did confuse me a little though.
                              Todou being defeated was great, because instead of faking a death its less of an ass pull if he's just
                              in a "knockdown" state instead of "presumbly dead". Mahito's transformation is ugly im not gonna lie. Todou
                              coming in with a fake out clap was PEAK. Itadori not killing mahito and just walking towards him was pissing me off,
                              I knew some bs was about to happen. Lets see if they fuse or something. Mahito went out BAD, but he was a lame villain anyway.</p>

                              The MeiMei scene is a 10/10 FOR SURE, glad she dipped outta there. She teasing the downfall of japan, im assuming ginraku told her the plan maybe.
                              Choso is awesome, his love for his brothers is great. All the side characters coming in, didnt do much but nice to see.
                              Ginraku became more interesting with the shit they revealed this episode.
                              Yuki's entrance was cool, lets see if she can hold it down and finish the season off strong. </p>

                              Can't wait to see how Megumi reacts to his sister waking up. Kyoto school was seriously ass, Todou carried those bums.
                              I didnt think they would take gojo, so that was a pleasant surprised. The scene with the girl was terrifying, i loved it. 
                              The real main character has finally showed up, YUTA MY KING. I doubt he actually wants to kill itadori, espically since Gojo believes in him.

                        and the gang are about to get folded. Looks promising.

                        We see his penalty for not doing his daily quests, wonder if that will be relevant later as well. Jim-woo enters a dungeon

                      <p class="card-text">The crew face off against Lillith and we get a glimpse of Shaka as he warns Lillith that
                        she is the one in danger, not them. Zoro flexing that right-hand man position in this scene. Luffy and gang get to
                        the surface of Egghead, and are welcomed with tons of Holograms! We're introduced to PUNK-02 Atlas. I like her 
                        a lot more in the anime. The voice acting gives her so much personality, and he interaction with Luffy is hilarious!
